^ "I enter the Teletransporter. I have been to Mars before, but only by the old method, a space-ship journey taking several weeks. This machine will send me at the speed of light. I merely have to press the green button. Like others, I am nervous. Will it work? I remind myself what I have been told to expect. When I press the button, I shall lose consciousness, and then wake up at what seems a moment later. In fact I shall have been unconscious for about an hour. The Scanner here on Earth will *destroy my brain and body*, while *recording the exact states of all of my cells*. It will then transmit this information by radio. Travelling at the speed of light, the message will take three minutes to reach the Replicator on Mars. This will then create, out of new matter, *a brain and body exactly like mine*. It will be in *this body* that I shall wake up. Though I believe that this is what will happen, I still hesitate. But then I remember seeing my wife grin when, at breakfast today, I revealed my nervousness. As she reminded me, she has been often teletransported, and there is nothing wrong with her. I press the button. As predicted, I lose and seem at once to regain consciousness, but in a different cubicle. Examining my *new body, I find no change at all*. Even the cut on my upper lip, from this morning’s shave, is still there."

^ Hi. My name is Alexis.

^ I've never been in a transporter, but it's a nice way to describe a PARALLEL I've noticed. Today I'd like to tell you about this parallel and then share a REFLECTION on it.

^ Some of this is theoretical, and some of this is a bit personal. I hope it _speaks_ to you. Thank you for listening.

^ But first, this is Derek Parfit.

^ He wrote that passage I just read, which begins his discussion of the _transporter problem_. It is from a chapter called "What We Believe Ourselves To Be", in the book "Reasons and Persons".

^ Parfit worked on the book for 15 years. Some have called it the most important book on moral philsophy since 1837. 

^ I first heard Parfit speak 20 years ago. In person, Parfit has exactly the distracted, unworldly air, and the dramatic hair that you would expect of a legendary moral philosopher.

^^ He is based at a special college in Oxford, All Souls College, which takes no students. All the professors have lifetime appointments. The college provides them food and board. (They are supposed to have one of the best wine cellars in the city.) And all they do is think.

^ You could say he's sort of an alpha nerd in the world of moral philosophy.

^ The transporter problem is intended to clarify ideas about personal identity.

^ Remember, the transporter consists of a _Scanner_ and a _Replicator_. The Scanner *"destroys your brain and body"*. But it records your entire physical state as information, which the Replicator uses to create a *"new brain and body exactly like yours"*.

^ Basically, it's NSCoding but for your body.

^ So the question is: are you willing to be transported? Do you push the green button? Is the transporter basically killing you, and creating a new person just like you? Or is it just moving you, by moving your body? Is it the same you coming out of the transporter?

^^ You might think it's just moving you, but what if there was a malfunction and the scanner didn't destroy you, and the replicator created a copy, so now there's two of you. Which one is the real you? None of them? Both?

^ It comes down to *what makes two people the same*. To consider this, Parfit distinguishes between *TWO WAYD that two things can be the same*.

---

# qualitatively identical

^ One way things can be the same is if they are *"qualitatively identical"*. This just means "exactly alike".

---

^ For instance, if identical twins were atom-for-atom identical two each other, then they would be qualitatively identical, like Fred and George Weasley.

^ But this is really only _one_ form of identity. Even if Fred and George were atom-for-atom identical with each other, they are not the _same_ person. They are two distinct people. One is Fred. The other is George. Fred is not the _same person as_ George.

^ So they are identical in one sense -- they are qualititatively identical -- but they are not identical in another sense. That other sense is _numerically identitical_.

---

# numerically identical

^ Two things are _numerically identical_ if they are "one and the same".

![right 75%](/Users/alexis/workspace/RW/DevCon/inspiration/image-aging/old.png)

^ The easiest example of this is just to consider that a thing is always the same as itself, even as time passes. Twelve year-old Fred Weasly is the same person as 18 year-old Fred Weasley, just as you are always the same as yourself.

^^ If you watched Fred Weasley age, you would see him change, but you would also see that it was the same person who was changing

^ So with this idea, we can restate the transporter problem. Remember, we suppose that the transporter *"preserves the exact state of every call"*. So, by definition, the person leaving the transporter is *qualitatively identitical* to you. The big question is if it's the _same_ you walking out -- if that person is _numerically identitical_.

^ That's actually a question about what kind of thing a *person* is.

^ From inside, I feel like it's the same me through time, like the me trying to lift the pumpkin is the same as the me holding an umbrella in college, who is the same as the me standing here now. But *what fact* makes that feeling true?

^ Is it just my physical continuity through space and time (like for an object like a rock)? Or is it the continuity of my memories, that I can remember holding the umbrella? (This is what John Locke believed.)

^ Parfit considers many theories. I will not review those here. Instead I'd now like to show you the parallel I promised.

![center 100%](/Users/alexis/workspace/RW/DevCon/inspiration/face-rich-hickey/8058501680_974af240f1_z.jpg)

^ But first -- this is Rich Hickey. Hickey is the creator of clojure, a very cool lisp dialect that runs on the Java Virtual Machine.

^^ I think I started hearing about Clojure about 3-4 years ago. In 2003 Paul Graham wrote an essay "Beating the Averages", where he described Lisp as a secret weapon for smart people, and basically said that it marked the maximal point on a continuum of language power. Whether or not it's true, this idea is of course enormously appealing to elitists everywhere, and it helped to re-awaken a general interest in Lisps.

^ Like Parfit, Rich Hickey also has dramatic hair. You could say he's an "alpha nerd" in the world of somewhat esoteric programming langauges.

---

![center 120%](/Users/alexis/workspace/RW/DevCon/inspiration/image-clojure-epochal/epochal-time-model.png)

^ I was reminded of Parfit's discusion of identity when I heard Hickey talking about this, which is the conceptual model of change underlying the Clojure's concurrency primitives.

^ Hickey calls an "identity" any logical continuously existing thing in the world, like a person. Every identity has a "state" that changes thru time. At any single point in time, that state can be described by a "value", which is a snapshot of its state.

^ In Clojure there is a system of special reference types for representing identities, and immutable persistent data structures for representing values, and they have nice concurrency semantics.


^ I was thinking revisiting this recently whent thinking about the meaning of value types in Swift. Value types are ideal for expressing the idea of a value, an permanent snapshot of a moment. When people want a clear why to think about how to use structs and constants in their app architecture, I think the best thing to study is this model from Clojure. And a lot of recent talks about Swift have been essentially restating its model.

---

^ So here's the PARALLEL I noticed. 

## numerically identical  : qualitatively identical
### ::
^ ## "one and the same" : "exactly alike"
^ ## ::
## same identity        : equal value

^ "numerically identical" is to "qualitatively identical" as "same identity" is to "equal value".

^ You can take that to the bank.

---

![center 200%](/Users/alexis/workspace/RW/DevCon/inspiration/image-EricEvans/Domain-driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-in-the-Heart-of-Software.jpg)

^ Later I learned that Clojure's model echoes earlier work. This is Eric Evans, who wrote a book on Domain-Drive Design, and describes this as the distinction between _entities_ and _value objects_. And Evans says he's also re-stating earlier ideas.

^ In retrospect, this is not surprising. 

^ You get to these idea as soon as you try to specify exactly what is staying the same about something that completely changes.

---

# [fit] identity

^^ ## What We Believe Ourselves To Be

^^ ### as stable as you choose

^ Well, okay: What is it that is staying the same? How should we define identity? To be honest, I'm not sure.

^ I find that the Clojure model and the Parfit's model are both clear when they talk about the snapshot of a thing in time -- about value, or qualititatively identical.

^ But they both get slippery when they talk about about identitiy, about what stays the same when everything changes.

^^ I have found the Clojure model of identity confusing. At times Hickey uses the term "identity" to mean *"a stable logical entity associated with a series of different values over time"*. But people use "identity" as if it means simply a kind of a language construct, any thing that holds or points to something else.

^^ Similarly, all the complexity of Parfit's account is also in this numerical identity part. In particular, he dismisses a version of identity that strikes me as quite releant: "Suppose that an artist paints a self-portrait and then, by repainting, turns this into a portrait of his father. Even though these portraits are more similar than a caterpillar and a butterfly, they are not stages in the continued existence of a single painting. The self-portrait is a painting that the artist destroyed. In a general discussion of identity, we would need to explain why the requirement of physical continui ty differs in such ways for different kinds of thing."

^ I think identity is a fundamentally subtle concept, a hard problem.

^ The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy has more than 10k words on identity in general, and another 10k words on personal identity. So this is simple, but it is subtle.

^ Thinking about it has only helped me understand the question. But it's worth thinking about. Everyone gets taught "is-a" vs "has-a" in OO design. But this is a more valuable, more fundamental, more subtle, more useful concept.

^ Now let me share my PERSONAL REFLECTION on this.

^ This is San Francisco.

^ I grew up in SF, moved away for 20 years, then moved back. When I moved back, for months I had the spooky feeling that I was not living in the real SF.

^ In other words, it seemed like someone had created perfect replica of SF. The old and new SF seemed to be equal but not the same, qualitatatively identical but not numerically identical.

^ This is a common experience when we go back to a place from a powerful time in our past, like childhood. The place has a feeling. That feeling is really the emotions that we felt at that time in our past.

^ When we visit the place, and our own emotions are different, the place feels wrong. It might seem sinister. Like you are meeting a familiar friend, who does not recognize you.

^^ "Locke claimed that someone cannot have committed some crime unless he now remembers doing so. We can understand a reluctance to punish people for crimes that they cannot remember. But, taken as a view about what is involved in a person’s continued existence, Locke’s claim is clearly false." Parfit 1984, p205.

![right 35%](/Users/alexis/workspace/RW/DevCon/inspiration/image-alexis/square_alexis_japan.jpg)

^ But it goes beyond just places.

^ At these moments in SF, I had a similar feeling that I was not really the real Alexis any more. That I was also some kind of a replica of my earlier self. That the new Alexis was different from the old one.

---

^ Before I say more, let me show you one more picture.

^ Does anyone recognize who this is?

![center 230%](/Users/alexis/workspace/RW/DevCon/inspiration/face-feynman/Richard-feynman.jpg)

^ Yes, this is Richard Feynman, a notable physicist. In addition to his physics he wrote a couple books of anecdotes, which made him famous. He won a Nobel prize. So, another "alpha nerd" with wild hair.

^ The last time I lived in SF, I was in high school, and at that time I was 100% obsessed with physics, and I thought Feynman was the coolest thing.

^ So part of the reason I felt unreal in SF was that SF was infused with child-Alexis-studying-physics, while I was grown-Alexis-building-software. And this felt like a radical change. 

^^ Feynman on computers: "There is a computer disease that anybody who works with computers knows about. It's a very serious disease and it interferes completely with the work. The trouble with computers is that you 'play' with them! They are so wonderful. You have these switches - if it's an even number you do this, if it's an odd number you do that - and pretty soon you can do more and more elaborate things if you are clever enough, on one machine.

![center 200%](/Users/alexis/workspace/RW/DevCon/inspiration/DekerParfitFace/110905_r21085_g2048-1190.jpg)

^ Let me quote from Parfit one last time. He describes one possible notion of identity: "Suppose that an artist paints a self-portrait and then, by repainting, turns this into a portrait of his father. Even though these portraits are more similar than a caterpillar and a butterfly, they are not stages in the continued existence of a single painting. The self-portrait is a painting that the artist destroyed. In a general discussion of identity, we would need to explain why the requirement of physical continuity differs in such ways for different kinds of thing."

---

^ Parfit dismisses this as irrelevant for people but it strikes me as a very evocative description of growth. Your story about yourself changes. You erase piece of yourself. If the change is big enough, you are likely to feel like you've become a new kind of thing.

^ Are you turning into a butterfly? Are you being destroyed?

# Is change growth?

# Is change destruction?

![fit](/Users/alexis/workspace/RW/DevCon/inspiration/image-caterpillartransformation/butterfly-1_cropped.jpeg)

^ Or is that the same thing?

^ Look at these CT scan of a caterpillar in its chrysalis. I think if you asked the caterpillar if it wanted to do this, it would probably say no thank you!

![center 80%](/Users/alexis/workspace/RW/DevCon/inspiration/image-disappointment/Photo 19-01-2015 16 06 58 cleaned.png)

^ Disappointment and frustration is also part of this.

^ I'm sure if I met my 16-year old self, he'd ask "Wait, you're not a physicist?!"

^ On the other hand, he'd also think iPhones were pretty wonderful. And when I was 16, they didn't exist, so it's hard to say he should be in charge.

![fit](/Users/alexis/workspace/RW/DevCon/inspiration/image-impostor/14991689529_9c956f21e2_h_croppedwide.jpeg)

^ This reminds me of discussions I see of _impostor syndrome_, the feeling that you're a phony, that you're only pretending to know what you're doing.

^ I've seen this described as a problem afflicting under-represented groups but I believe it's a universal part of the human experience.

^ For instance, personally, every 4-6 months, I notice intense feelings of frustration that I don't really understand software well and embarrasment at my ignorance of basic things

^ This is probably because every 4-6 months I am working on something subtantially new to me. But that doesn't change the feeling. So, every time, I need to remind myself I'm probably not an idiotn even though I like one.

^ But part of me does wonder, would I feel more real if I had wild hair and lived in a black and white photo like one of these alpha nerds?

^ What does it feel like inside these photos?

^ After "Reasons and Persons" Parfit spent about twenty years working on one more book, "On What Matters". Reviews were less positive. One reviewer wrote: "For these reasons I see the biggest and most central part of the book as a failure, possibly wrong but more worryingly “not even wrong”..." Did Parfit feel less like the real Parfit after reading that?

^^ Or how does Hickey look on the decades when he was doing C++ and Java, before inventing Clojure? Does he look at that period as the prelude, the moment before his real professional career started?

^^ In his books, Feynman writes about feeling of inadequacy, of being an impostor, of not being able to meet expectations, in his first years teaching.

^^ Identity feels different from the inside

---

# 1. Identity is a perspective

^ So, what am I saying? Here is a summary in three claims.

^ Claim 1: Identity is a perspective

^ In our systems, there is room to think more rigorously even about something that seems as seemingly straightforward as how to represent one thing that changes through time.

^ On the personal level, this is also subtle. We make choices about what we regard as coherent.

---

# 2. Reality is the moments

^ However you end up defining identity, the brute fact that you are actually working with is a sequence of moments, of values, of snapshots.

^ So what makes us the same person? On a personal level, I think it's just that we decide to see ourselves that way, that we tell a story that can string those moments together into one thread.

---

# 3. Time is a transporter

^ But this is all imposed by perspective because, on a physical level, time is a transporter. Whether you want it to be or not.

^ Every moment, the atoms inside you are being recycled and replaced. You are being destroyed and re-created. You are changing.

^ So you don't need to ask yourself if the scanner will destroy you. You are already being destroyed, by time.

---

![fit](/Users/alexis/workspace/RW/DevCon/inspiration/image-transporter/transporter3c.jpg)

^ So, personally, I think I would step in the transporter. But I would try not to think too hard about it, and keep my focus on the future.

---

![center 125%](/Users/alexis/workspace/RW/DevCon/inspiration/face-sartre/Jean-Paul_Sartre_FP.jpg)

^ This is Sartre

^ Sartre even managed to feel like his own hands were unreal: "“I feel my hand. I am these two beasts struggling at the end of my arms. My hand scratches one of its paws with the nail of the other paw; I feel its weight on the table which is not me. It's long, long, this impression of weight, it doesn't pass. There is no reason for it to pass. It becomes intolerable ... I draw back my hand and put it in my pocket; but immediately I feel the warmth of my thigh through the stuff. I pull my hand out of my pocket and let it hang against the back of the chair. Now I feel a weight at the end of my arm. It pulls a little, softly, insinuatingly it exists. I don't insist: no matter where I put it it will go on existing; I can't suppress it, nor can I suppress the rest of my body, the sweaty warmth, which soils my shirt, nor all this warm obesity which turns lazily, as if someone were stirring it with a spoon, nor all the sensations going on inside, going, coming, mounting from my side to my armpit or quietly vegetating from morning to night, in their usual corner.”"

---

^ This is Heraclitus

![center 35%](/Users/alexis/workspace/RW/DevCon/inspiration/image-heraclitus/Utrecht_Moreelse_Heraclite.JPG)

^ He was born in the 6th century BC (535 BC). He is most famous for leaving behind cryptics fragments of a philosophy

^ "We both step and do not step in the same rivers. We are and are not."
